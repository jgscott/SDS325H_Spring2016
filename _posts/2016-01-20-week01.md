title: Week 1 (January 20, 2016)
---

Welcome to SDS 325H!  On the first day of class, we'll give an overview of the course [(the course syllabus is here.)]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/syllabus_SDS325H_spring2016.pdf)  As a gentle introduction to the initial material, we will talk about some basic principles that separate good statistical graphics from bad ones.  We will then begin our discussion of exploratory data analysis in the context of contingency tables for categorical data.  

### Software

The first thing to do is to install [R](http://www.r-project.org) and then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer.  Detailed instructions for installing these two programs [can be found here](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/basics/installing_R.html).  Both are free.

R is the underlying data-analysis program we'll use in this course, while RStudio provides a nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetitive steps (e.g. loading data, saving plots) very simple.   I will use RStudio in class most days this semester, and you will use it most weeks for your homework.  RStudio depends upon having R available behind the scenes, so make sure you install both, even though you won't need to interact directly with R.

Once you've installed R and RStudio, complete the following three R walkthroughs.  The first two are designed to get you off the ground, while the third kicks off our unit on exploratory data analysis by walking you through a few methods for analzying categorical data using contingency tables.   
- [Getting started with R.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/heights/heights.html)   
- [Installing a library in R.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/basics/installing_library.html)    
- [Introduction to contingency tables.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/titanic/titanic.html)  


### Readings

All readings are accessible through the Resources tab, above.

* Course packet: Introduction and Chapter 1.
* Chapter 1 of Kaplan: mainly useful as an introduction to R.  Feel free to move rapidly if you're feeling comfortable with the software.

The material this week and next also coincides roughly with Chapter 1 of OpenIntro: Statistics.  You should not feel obligated to read this, but it would be a good supplement for anyone looking for additional study materials or review of your first statistics class.  

### Exercises

The first set of exercises is available through the [Exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises.html) tab above.  The goal is to get started with R, and with doing exploratory data analysis.  Due Monday, February 1, 2016. 

### Additional practice with R  

If you are feeling a little uncomfortable with the idea of R, do not worry.  We will practice a lot in class.  But if you'd like, you can get a jump start on things by following along with all the R commands in Chapters 1-3 of Kaplan.  Just replicate exactly what he does in your own R session.  Don't just copy and paste; actually type the commands yourself!  It's the best way to learn them.
